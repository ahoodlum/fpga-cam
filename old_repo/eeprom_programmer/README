This project is a work in progress

It's aim is to allow to program the SPARTCAM I2C EEPROM through the USB communication.
The project is divided into two parts : 
    - the hdl project, which will be implemented in the FPGA to handle the I2C protocol and the interface with the computer
    - a computer program to send the configuration data with to the FPGA.

Currently, the HDL part is written in VHDL and uses parts of the SPARTCAM project. The PC part is written in Python which seems fine for fast prototyping.
