* This timing constraint interaction report can be used to understand which    *
* timing constraints take precedence when two or more timing constraints cover *
* a common set of timing paths.                                                *

* Constraint coverage over a set of paths is based on the following precedence *
* order (lowest to highest precedence):                                        *
*                                                                              *

* When two or more timing constraints have the same precedence, an optional    *
* PRIORITY qualifier can be used to identify the constraint that should take   *
* precedence for path coverage. If no PRIORITY qualifier exists, the last      *
* constraint encountered in the constraint file will take precedence.          *
*                                                                              *
* The following report lists constraints interactions, where lower-priority    *
* constraints had paths removed due to higher-priority constraints. For each   *
* interaction, the higher-priority constraint and number of paths removed are  *
* listed.                                                                      *

* In addition, if two or more interacting constraints have a similar type, a   *
* set of potential constraint consolidations may be reported. It may be        *
* possible to reduce the memory and runtime required for timing analysis by    *
* combining similar constraints.                                               *
*                                                                              *
* A clock domain overlap report will be produced when multiple                 *
* period/frequency constraints are defined to cover the same synchronous       *
* destination elements. This overlap report displays the set of overlapping    *
* constraints in precedence order (lowest to highest precedence) along with    *
* the list of synchronous destination elements shared by those constraints.    *
* The destination elements are listed using their logical resource name        *
* followed parenthetically by their physical resource name and physical clock  *
* pin name.                                                                    *

* The clock domain overlap report can be used to detect and correct            *
* overlapping constraint specifications that may be unintentionally altering   *
* the desired clock domain membership and resultant timing analysis of a       *
* design.                                                                      *

  Consolidating the following similar constraints may reduce the memory and runtime required for timing analysis:
    PATH "TS_TIG1_path" TIG;
    PATH "TS_TIG2_path" TIG;

  Consolidating the following similar constraints may reduce the memory and runtime required for timing analysis:
    Unconstrained OFFSET IN BEFORE analysis for clock "spi_sck_BUFGP"
